# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

First packaged release. Same public API as the original single file:
`from micromcp import MCP, Server, ASGIServer, Context, Principal`.

### Packaging
- `src/` layout, nine modules, hatchling build, Apache-2.0, Python 3.11+.
- Django adapters live in `micromcp.contrib.django` (still re-exported from
  `micromcp` for existing code).
- `tools/bundle.py` regenerates a single vendorable `micromcp.py`; CI
  regenerates it and runs every suite against it.
- The per-server tunables (`keepalive`, `cancel_grace`, `queue_size`,
  `offload_bytes`, `stream_budget`, `workers`, `timeout`, `max_body`) are
  constructor options; the module constants are only their defaults.

### Hardening (three rounds of adversarial review, 2026-09-13)
- Principal/Context detection is structural and fail-closed: works through
  Optional, Union, Annotated, PEP 695 aliases, callable instances, partials;
  unresolvable marker-looking annotations and marker subclasses are refused.
- Guards apply to resources, prompts, and listings; denials are not-found.
- Arguments are validated against the published schema (constraints
  included, `$defs` namespaced per parameter) and converted to the declared
  Python types before the handler runs; outputs are validated against
  `outputSchema`. Validation happens before any response byte is committed.
- Transport: envelope validation, notifications acknowledged with 202,
  duplicate-header rejection, body limits with 413-before-read, Content-Type,
  Host, CORS, Accept handling, constant error text outside `tools/call`.
- Runtime: per-server daemon thread pools that are fork-aware and refuse with
  503 when full; a separate lane for `authenticate`; WSGI `timeout`; SSE
  backpressure, keepalives, per-call byte budget, cooperative cancellation
  via `ctx.cancelled`.
